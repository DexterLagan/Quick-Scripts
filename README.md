# Quick Scripts for DrRacket

A collection of useful QuickScripts for DrRacket.

How to Install:
Copy the scripts to your quickscript folder.

How to Use:
Scripts should automatically appear in your Scripts menu.

compile-standalone compiles the current program to a standalone binary, and automatically imports an icon (located in ./icon). Unlike DrRacket's default compilation option, it does not zip the resulting files.

generate-provide generates a provide form for the current module, and automatically writes a summary of each exported function.

skeleton-generator generates a program skeleton with nicely commented sections, and optionally includes useful macros and definitions.
