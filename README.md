# Quick Scripts for DrRacket

A collection of useful QuickScripts for DrRacket.

<b>How to Install:</b><br>
Copy the scripts to your quickscript folder. On Windows, this path is:<br>
<pre>
%USERPROFILE%\AppData\Roaming\Racket\quickscript\user-scripts
</pre>

<b>How to Use:</b><br>
In DrRacket, click on the 'Scripts' menu, and click on the script you want to use.

<u><b>Here is a short description of each script:</u></b><br>

<b>compile-standalone</b><br>
compiles the current program to a standalone binary, and automatically imports an icon (located in ./icon). Unlike DrRacket's default compilation option, it does not zip the resulting files.

<b>generate-provide</b><br>
generates a provide form for the current module, and automatically writes a summary of each exported function.

<b>generate-skeleton</b><br>
generates a program skeleton with nicely commented sections, and optionally includes useful macros and definitions.

<b>escape-double-quotes</b><br>
adds a back-slash ('\') before every double-quote ('"') in the selection.

<br>
Cheers,<br>
